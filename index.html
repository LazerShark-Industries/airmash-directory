            <p>Airmash,the game that started it all,as a web browser game with Open Source code on Github.
              This game started in 2017, made by a programmer known as Five/Ninesigma or Tony. 
              Growing more and more as it was announced on Hacker-News.
              The game is a mix of programmers and players from all over the world. 
              The US CTF mode was where it all started, the legacy of airmash.
              Players flying their planes, gaining their skill, while chatting with awesome pilots. 
              If they spoke their language of course.
              Come Along, Join the battle, Join the community, Most importantly be part of the Airmash Family!</p>

            <p>Starmash, a mod for airmash made by an awesome programmer known as, Bombita or Molesmalo.
              Starmash has themes and extensions that gives the client a one of a kind feeling.
              First started as a starwars version, to many volunteered themes from players like, Moz://a and xplay.
              As more and more themes came, more game-features came as-well.
              Some like the Prowler Radar, the infamous TPM - Targeting Players on the Minimap, to even crowns on the mini map for the players in 1st 2nd and 3rd.
              Beware Though, the more themes and features added, the harder it becomes to make the game smoother, meaning the bigger processor needed.
              Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Breadmash started all with the rampage of a teen at the age of 14 during mid fall 2020.
              This teen known by many aliases commonly, B, started playing during the empty times of the game in 2017 before the HN release as Mr.Dot.
              "As more and more players came, a new one joined named, Moz://a, gave me inspiration for the name Chromnium. Later on I decided to us ΛIRMΛSH, that turned into a sunken ship quickly."
              "ΛIRMΛSH was 1 reason I led my rampage, revenge for the name. The Main Reason was the moderation needs in ffa #1."
              he spammed the reddit airmash sub-directory, asking for moderator powers, but recieved many rejections from the new "owner"/volunteered developer, Congratulatio.
              "I had a talk with Spatie, where he told me that Congratulatio was the man that brought airmash back for everyone. I apologized after, now knowing that Congratulatio had brought back my escape from the world."
              B explains that Congratulatio understood his moderation rampage, and explained that that wasn't the best solution. 
              Congratulatio then helped B join the airmash community of devs by helping him bypass certain things on his school chromebook and teaching him around github and the real programming world of airmash.
              Along with helping B learn code. Congratulatio set up the vm4b server, having B take the steps to officially set it playable. 
              B codes the airmash future designs, game-modes, etc while sharing a strong bond/apprenticeship with Congratulatio.
              "We don't need a ton of players, we just need a bit more imagination to keep the game alive within us the old guys, That's where I come in >:D"
              Breadmash, The Future Of Airmash.</p>

              1 thing that makes it the best client, The Super Cool Sunglasses on the planes.</p>
